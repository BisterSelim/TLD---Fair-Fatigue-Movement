**TLD - Fair Fatigue Movement**

This mod balances the unrealistic fatigue rate caused by the time-scale difference in The Long Dark.

**The Problem:**

Walking 200 meters takes 1 hour in game time, causing the character to get exhausted as if they walked for an hour in real life.
The Solution: This mod dynamically reduces fatigue increase only while walking, making exploration feel more natural.

**Features**

Adjustable Multiplier: Change the fatigue rate via ModSettings menu.

**Sprinting Logic:**     Keep vanilla fatigue for sprinting while making walking fair.

**Zero Impact on Other Mechanics:**     Hunger, thirst, and cold remain untouched.



**Our Main Goal:**

Our primary goal here is to eliminate the mismatch between the game's time flow and our character's walking speed.
In daily life, a person doesn't get as tired as if they had walked for 2 hours after walking 200 meters.
This reduces the need to constantly rest in the game.
Our aim is not to alter the game's core difficulty, but there's no need to suffer to explore and enjoy.
