# TLD---Fair-Fatigue-Movement
this mod balances the unrealistic fatigue rate caused by the time-scale difference in The Long Dark. -- Walking 200 meters takes 1 hour in game time, causing the character to get exhausted as if they walked for an hour in real life. The Solution: This mod dynamically reduces fatigue increase only while walking, making exploration feel more natural.
